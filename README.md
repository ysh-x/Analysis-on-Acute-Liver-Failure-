Analysis on Acute Liver Failure using Apache Hadoop

## Problem Statement

Acute liver failure is loss of liver function that occurs quickly — in days or weeks usually in a person who has no preexisting liver disease. It's most commonly caused by a hepatitis virus or drugs, such as acetaminophen. Acute liver failure is less common than chronic liver failure, which develops more slowly. Acute liver failure, also known as fulminate hepatic failure, can cause serious complications, including bleeding and increased pressure in the brain. It's a medical emergency that requires hospitalization. Depending on the cause, acute liver failure can sometimes be reversed with treatment. In many situations, though, a liver transplant may be the only cure. Following are the symptoms of acute liver failure.

- Yellowing of your skin and eyeballs (jaundice)
- Pain in your upper right abdomen
- A swollen belly (ascites)
- Nausea
- Vomiting
- A general sense of feeling unwell (malaise)
- Disorientation or confusion
- Sleepiness
- Breath may have a musty or sweet odor
- Tremors

## Dataset

Since 1990, the JPAC Center for Health Diagnosis and Control, has conducted nationwide surveys of Indian adults. Using trained personnel, the center had collected a wide variety of demographic and health information using direct interviews, examinations, and blood samples. The data setconsists of selected information from 8,785 adults 20 years of age or older taken from the 2008–2009 and 2014–2015 surveys.

Cirrhosis is when scar tissue replaces healthy liver tissue. This stops the liver from working
normally. Cirrhosis is a long-term (chronic liver disease or acute liver failure). The damage to your
liver builds up over time. The liver is your body’s largest internal organ. It lies up under your ribs
on the right side of your belly. Liver removes waste from the body, such as toxins and medicines, Makes bile to help digest food, Stores sugar that the body uses for energy and Makes new proteins.
When you have cirrhosis, scar tissue slows the flow of blood through the liver. Over time, the
liver can’t work the way it should. In severe cases, the liver gets so badly damaged that it stops
working. This is called liver failure.
Literature on the incidence and prevalence of liver cirrhosis is scarce but figures suggest that
around 0.1% of the population in Europe is affected.
